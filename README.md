Use the following steps to access the Robotarium examples (after installing anaconda):
1.  **conda create --name [name of environment] --file quad_sim_env.txt** (this will create a python environment with the
necessary package requirements)
1. **conda activate [name of environment]** (activate the environment)
1. **pip install control** (install the python-control through pip)
1. **cd quadcopter-simulator-python/**
1. **python3 -m examples.[filename]** (run the files in the examples/ directory using this command)
